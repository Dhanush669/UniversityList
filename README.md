# UniversityList
 I have built this app with Java, MVVM architecture, Volley, Room Database, SQLITE.
 During online mode this app will load full data available on API, clicking on university will show the details of university and a link to the university official website.
 During offline user will be notified with a indicatior, and only 20 data of universities will be stored on local storage.
